### Brief Account of Experimentation
- At the start, I copied the code shown in the workshop task this included the isNoun code section and the rhymesSynce section. Although these were shown in two separate parts I decided to combine both of these sections. After using the isNoun code, I found that there were also isVerb and isAdjective functions which did the same thing as isNoun but for verbs and adjectives respectively. This meant I then ended up with code that would take in the user input and if the code had a rhyme in the RiTa library it would randomly swap out the word for a rhyme if it did not it would randomly replace it with a word based on the type of word it was (for example giving it orange would replace it with a different noun as orange does not have a rhyme in the library). After finishing with the code, I added the pluralize function which would update the code to so that every odd numbered word would be pluralized as along as they had a rhyme.

### Future Development
- I saw that there was an alliterations function in the RiTa library and I want to utilize it in some way but I wasn't able to figure it out when working on the task.
